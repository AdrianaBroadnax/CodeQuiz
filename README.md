# CodeQuiz

# JavaScript
First I started by adding the variables that will be used to make the code quiz.

Then I added an if function so if the user refreshes the page or returns to the browser page it will pick up where they left off. 

The quiz will be timed for 90 seconds. 

<!-- ** I tried to make the start button but it's not starting the quiz, so i have to go back and fix that -->
Tried to add the start button command.

Next, I put the 3 quiz questions in a container with the multiple coice options and the answer.

Also added a function to track how many right answers the user has gotten.

If the user wins by getting all the questions right, then an alert will be sent out
If the user losses an alert will be sent out

Then the user can put their name on the highscores list


# Index.html
I started off putting script for the main.js in the header.

Then I added a header for the highscores and the timer. next i made a section where the questions were suppose to display.

Next I put a highscore page together that will display after the user has finished the quiz. On the highscore page the user will be able to put their initials and see their score along with others who took the test.
